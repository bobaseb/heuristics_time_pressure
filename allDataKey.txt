condition: tally = tallying, ttb = take-the-best
sub = subject number
phase/block: 1 = practice, 2 = no time pressure, 3 = with time pressure
stimuli_number for comparing between blocks
trial_ordering is trial number within a block (i.e. when that stimuli was presented for that block)
trial_difficulty: 1 = easy, 2 = medium, 3 = hard
correct_response: 1 = left (country A), 2 = right (country B)
sub_response: 1 = left (country A), 2 = right (country B)
reaction_time is in milliseconds

cue_value_rank: -1 = red cross on left (country A) & green checkmark on right (country B)
		1 = green checkmark on left (country A) & red cross on right (country B)
		0 = black equals sign (countries are tied on cue value)	
		cue_value_rank1 = best cue ----> cue_value_rank7 = worst cue

position: position1 = first cue shown (top to bottom) --> position7 = last cue shown (top to bottom)
		1 = best cue ---> 7 = worst cue  shown for that screen position
